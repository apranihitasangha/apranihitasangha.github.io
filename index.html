                <h1>About the sangha</h1>
                <p> The word 'apranihita' is a Sanskrit term for aimlessness. 
                In Buddhism and Advaita Vedantic texts like the Ashtavakra Samhita, aimlessness is prescribed as the penultimate sadhana. 
                The Buddha describes three doors to liberation: Non-self, signlessness (no form), and aimlessness (no goal/desire). 
                All three doors point to one reality—the reality of dependent origination. According to the Buddha, one who sees dependent origination as a fact of existence is already free. 
                The concept of dependent origination has been extensively studied and utilized by monks and laymen throughout ancient India and other parts of Asia to attain liberation. 
                Nagarjuna, the renowned teacher of the ancient Nalanda University, provides a rigorous treatment of dependent origination in his most famous work, the <i>Mūlamadhyamakakārikā</i>. </p>

                <p>In modern times, teachings of sages like Jiddu Krishnamurti emphasize aimlessness as an important tool to understand our own 'self'. 
                His famous quote 'Truth is a pathless land' encapsulates the idea that aimlessness is a door to liberation.</p>

                <p> Here at Apranihita Sangha, we aim to provide a platform where one can use the doors of liberation—no-self, signlessness (no-form), and aimlessness—to journey back to our home, freedom. 
                This platform will draw guidance from the teachings of all great sages without discrimination, using them as tools and discarding them once transcended. </p>
